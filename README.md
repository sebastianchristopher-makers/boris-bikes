# Boris Bikes

> *Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.*

Makers have provided 22 challenges to help structure this project. They are cumulative, so should be done one after the other. The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md).

## Focus goals:

I can TDD anything
- By the end of this week you should be able to write a meaningful test, based on the user requirements. You'll then be able to write code using TDD, to make the test pass.

I can program fluently
- You'll learn how to setup and structure a new Ruby project, and turn user requirements into working code.

I can debug anything
- You'll be introduced to a technique for uncovering the root-cause of bugs in your code. When your code doesn't work, you'll be able to apply a consistent process to resolve the issue.
